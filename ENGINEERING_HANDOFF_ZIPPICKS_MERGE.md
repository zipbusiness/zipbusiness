# Engineering Handoff: ZipPicks Data Engine Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the work completed to merge the advanced features from `zippicks-data-engine` into the production `zipbusiness-api` system, following the recommendations from the API audit.

## Completed Work (Phases 1-2)

### Phase 1: Data Model Extensions ✅

#### Extended Restaurant Model
Added the following fields to the `Restaurant` model while maintaining backward compatibility:

**Enhanced Data Quality Metrics:**
- `data_confidence` (Float) - Enhanced confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- `verification_sources` (Array[String]) - List of verification sources
- `last_quality_check` (DateTime) - Last quality assessment timestamp

**Trending and Analytics:**
- `rating_trend` (Float) - Positive/negative trend indicator
- `is_trending` (Boolean) - Currently trending flag
- `social_buzz_score` (Integer) - Social media engagement score (0-100)
- `optimal_visit_times` (JSONB) - Best times to visit based on analysis

**Enhanced Attributes:**
- `popular_dishes` (Array[String]) - Extracted from reviews
- `recent_mentions` (Integer) - Recent social media mentions count
- `is_new_opening` (Boolean) - New restaurant indicator

#### New Data Models Created

1. **RestaurantQualityMetrics**
   - One-to-one relationship with Restaurant
   - Tracks completeness, freshness, source agreement scores
   - Quality tier classification (1-5)
   - Field-level completeness tracking

2. **RestaurantTrend**
   - Time-series data for performance tracking

#### Database Migration
Created Alembic migration: `20250709_add_enhanced_data_models.py`
- Adds all new columns with proper defaults
- Creates new tables with appropriate indexes
- Ensures backward compatibility

### Phase 2: Service Integration ✅

Created `app/services/intelligence/` module with four key services:

#### 1. TrendingAnalyzer (`trending_analyzer.py`)

- Identifies improving/declining restaurants
- Calculates optimal visit times from review patterns
- Provides confidence scores and volatility metrics
- Integration with existing Restaurant and new RestaurantTrend models

#### 2. SocialMediaTracker (`social_media_tracker.py`)
- Tracks mentions across platforms (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, TikTok)
- Calculates engagement and trending scores
- Sentiment analysis on social mentions
- Viral content detection with platform-specific thresholds
- Updates restaurant social_buzz_score automatically

#### 3. ReviewAnalyzer (`review_analyzer.py`)
- Extracts popular dishes from review text
- Identifies positive/negative aspects by category
- Calculates sentiment scores
- Extracts common themes (date night, family-friendly, etc.)
- Provides aspect-specific scores (service, food, ambiance, value)

#### 4. QualityScorer (`quality_scorer.py`)
- Multi-dimensional quality assessment
- Completeness scoring with field weights
- Freshness scoring based on data age
- Source agreement validation
- Generates actionable recommendations
- Updates RestaurantQualityMetrics automatically

#### Updated Dependencies
Added to `requirements.txt`:
- scikit-learn (ML capabilities)
- textblob, nltk (NLP for review analysis)
- fuzzywuzzy, python-Levenshtein (fuzzy matching)
- phonenumbers (phone validation)
- geopy (geocoding services)
- structlog (enhanced logging)

## Remaining Work

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Enhancements

#### 3.1 Caching Layer Enhancement
**File:** `app/services/cache_service.py`
- Add cache strategies for trending data
- Implement cache warming for popular queries
- Add TTL configurations for different data types

#### 3.2 Monitoring Integration
**Files to create:**
- `app/monitoring/metrics.py` - Prometheus metrics setup
- `app/monitoring/collectors.py` - Custom metric collectors

**Tasks:**
- Add Prometheus metrics for:
  - Data quality scores
  - API response times by endpoint
  - Cache hit rates
  - Intelligence service performance
- Enhance logging with quality metrics
- Add alerting thresholds

### Phase 4: API Endpoints

#### 4.1 New Endpoints to Create

**Trending Endpoints:**
```python
# app/api/v1/endpoints/trending.py
GET /api/v1/restaurants/{zpid}/trending
- Returns: TrendAnalysis with rating trends, optimal times

GET /api/v1/analytics/trending
- Query params: city, limit
- Returns: List of trending restaurants
```

**Social Media Endpoints:**
```python
# app/api/v1/endpoints/social.py
GET /api/v1/restaurants/{zpid}/social
- Returns: SocialMediaSummary with platform metrics

GET /api/v1/analytics/viral
- Query params: city, days
- Returns: Restaurants with viral content
```

**Quality Endpoints:**
```python
# app/api/v1/endpoints/quality.py
GET /api/v1/restaurants/{zpid}/quality
- Returns: QualityAssessment with scores and recommendations

GET /api/v1/quality/metrics
- Query params: min_score, max_tier
- Returns: Quality distribution statistics
```

#### 4.2 Update Existing Endpoints

**Restaurant Search** (`/api/v1/restaurants`):
- Add query filters:
  - `is_trending` (boolean)
  - `min_quality_score` (float)
  - `min_social_buzz` (integer)
- Include new fields in response

**Restaurant Detail** (`/api/v1/restaurants/{zpid}`):

    QUALITY_THRESHOLDS = {...}
    SOCIAL_PLATFORMS = [...]
    # etc.
```

## Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Backward Compatibility**: All new fields are optional with sensible defaults
2. **Service Independence**: Intelligence services are modular and can be disabled
3. **Performance**: Heavy use of caching and database indexes
4. **Data Quality**: Multi-source verification remains the primary approach

### Critical Paths

1. **Database Migration**: Must be run before deploying new code
2. **Dependencies**: New Python packages must be installed
3. **Configuration**: New environment variables need to be set
4. **Background Tasks**: Scheduling system needs to be configured

### Potential Risks

1. **Performance Impact**: New queries may need optimization
2. **API Rate Limits**: Social media APIs have strict limits
3. **Data Storage**: New fields increase database size
4. **Cache Invalidation**: Complex with new data relationships
